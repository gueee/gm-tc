### API Endpoints (Production)
```
GET  /                          - API information
GET  /health                    - Health check
POST /api/v1/auth/register      - User registration
POST /api/v1/auth/login         - User login (returns JWT tokens)
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Register: `POST /api/v1/auth/register` with email, password, full_name
2. Login: `POST /api/v1/auth/login?email=...&password=...`
3. Returns: access_token (15 min), refresh_token (7 days)
4. Use: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header for protected routes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### During Development
1. ✅ Python 3.6 too old → Upgraded to Python 3.11
2. ✅ Wrong repository directory name → Fixed paths in docs
3. ✅ Redundant commands in deployment guide → Cleaned up
4. ✅ Service listening on wrong interface (127.0.0.1) → Changed to 0.0.0.0
5. ✅ Passlib bcrypt backend initialization error → Replaced with direct bcrypt

### All Systems Operational
- Backend API: ✅ Working
- Authentication: ✅ Working
- Database: ✅ Working
- Service: ✅ Running
- SSL/HTTPS: ✅ Working
- Logging: ✅ Working

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **FastAPI** - Excellent choice, fast development
2. **Uberspace** - Easy deployment, good documentation
3. **Modular architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides helped deployment
5. **Git workflow** - Commits were clean and descriptive

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Python version mismatch** - Server had old Python 3.6
2. **Bcrypt compatibility** - Passlib had issues, switched to direct bcrypt
3. **Network interface** - Needed 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1
4. **Repository naming** - Directory name confusion (gm-tc vs gmtc-crm)

### Improvements for Next Phase
1. Add comprehensive unit tests as we build
2. Consider PostgreSQL migration (optional)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Add API rate limiting
5. Implement better error logging
